## Chapter 2. When Stories Shape Belief: Tradition, Testimony, and the Problem of Anecdotes

### 2.1 Why Anecdotes Persuade Us
Human groups long relied on oral traditions—stories of healers, remedies, rituals—as primary “evidence.”  
Such traditions privilege *vivid* and *memorable* experiences, feeding what we now call the **Availability Heuristic** and **Anecdotal Evidence**.

**Key Vocabulary Embedded:**  
- **Anecdotal Evidence** – personal testimony or N=1 accounts; highly prone to bias.  
- **Availability Heuristic** – memorable events over-weighted in judgment.  
- **Confirmation Bias** – remembering only the parts that agree with what we already believe.

**Historical Notes & JLL Sources**  
Early medical disputes between empiricists and dogmatists show how testimony and tradition alone fueled disagreement. Celsus describes how different ancient schools each trusted their own stories and experiences while rejecting others, illustrating the enduring epistemic instability of anecdote-based medicine.

### 2.2 Why Anecdotes Mislead: Natural History, Regression to the Mean, and Post-hoc Fallacies
Before controlled comparisons, improvement was often mistaken as proof of treatment. Many conditions improve due to their **Natural History of Disease**, not interventions. Symptoms that peak and subside create **Regression to the Mean**, making any remedy given at the worst moment appear effective.

**Key Vocabulary Embedded:**  
- **Natural History of Disease** – what happens without treatment.  
- **Regression to the Mean** – extreme symptoms tend to move toward average.  
- **Post-hoc reasoning** – assuming A caused B simply because A preceded B.

**Historical Notes & JLL Sources**  
Ancient medical writers recognized that “experience can be dangerous”—cases improve or worsen for many reasons not related to treatment. Al-Razi emphasized the uncertainty of experience and the need to compare groups to distinguish real from illusory benefit.

### 2.3 The Power—and Limits—of Expert Authority  
For millennia, expert standing determined credibility. Yet experts disagreed sharply, even when all relied on experience alone. Without structured comparison, authority becomes arbitrary.

**Key Vocabulary Embedded:**  
- **Hierarchy of Evidence** (historical precursor) – expert authority at the bottom; controlled comparison above it.

**Historical Notes & JLL Sources**  
Celsus explicitly asked: “Why should anyone believe Hippocrates rather than Herophilus?” highlighting that differing authorities, relying on anecdotal experience, produced contradictory judgments.

### 2.4 Social Transmission of Medical Myths and the Modern Parallel  
Medical beliefs traditionally spread through oral networks—healers, midwives, travelers, families—mirroring today’s social media. The modern amplification of misinformation resembles early reliance on vivid narrative rather than structured evidence.

**Key Vocabulary Embedded:**  
- **Recall Bias** – selective memory favors striking stories.  
- **Biological Plausibility** – stories often rely on plausible mechanisms even when false.

**Historical Notes & JLL Sources**  
Haygarth’s work on placebo “tractors” demonstrates how persuasive narratives and community enthusiasm can sustain ineffective treatments until tested rigorously.

### 2.5 Why This Matters for Evidence-Based Medicine  
Anecdotes evoke meaning and emotional salience—but they cannot reveal causation. Understanding their seductive power prepares the reader for why comparisons, controls, and methodological safeguards are essential.
